Fitness Tracker Database - README
Overview
This project creates and manages a Fitness Tracker Database to store, analyze, and summarize user activity data. The database helps in tracking user activities like steps taken, distances covered, active and sedentary minutes, and calories burned. The SQL scripts provided enable the creation of tables, views, and the generation of various summaries, trends, and reports based on user activity.

Features
The database provides the following key features:

Daily Activity Summary: Tracks daily steps, distance covered, active minutes, sedentary minutes, and calories burned for each user.
Weekly and Monthly Aggregates: Aggregates data on a weekly and monthly basis, allowing for an analysis of user activity over larger time frames.
Top/Bottom Users: Identifies the top 10 most active and bottom 10 least active users by total steps within a specific period.
Activity Trends: Analyzes trends in daily steps and calories burned over time for each user.
Clustering of Users by Activity Level: Classifies users into categories (Highly Active, Moderately Active, Low Activity) based on their average daily steps and active minutes.
Dashboard View: Provides a view that summarizes user activity data, useful for displaying on dashboards or for reporting.
